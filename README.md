Implementation of the Uniform Consensus Algorithm using the following abstractions:
  - BestEfforBroadcaset (Basic)
  - EventuallyPerfectFailureDetector (Increasing Timeout)
  - EventualLeaderDetector (Monarchical)
  - Epoch Change  (Leader-Based Epoch-Change)
  - Epoch Consensus (Read/Write Epoch Consensus)
